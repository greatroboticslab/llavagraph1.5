    "response": "C) Square wave. The description provided indicates a deterministic, periodic alternation between two distinct states with abrupt jumps and sharp angles, which aligns with the characteristics of a square wave. Options A and B do not match the description given, as A suggests randomness and B suggests smoothness and continuity, neither of which are mentioned in the description.<|end|>"

    "response": "C) Square wave. The description provided indicates that the graph has a deterministic pattern with abrupt corners and sudden decreases in value, which are characteristic of a square wave. This eliminates options A (Random noise) and B (Sine wave), as they do not match the described features.<|end|>"
