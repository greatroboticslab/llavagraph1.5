    "response": "Based on the provided information, I would select option B) Sine wave.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n- The graph's waveform is described as having a smooth, periodic nature with symmetrical peak excursions, which aligns with the characteristics of a sine wave.\n- The graph is described as having a coherent, uninterrupted, and non-random pattern, indicating a consistent structure, which is also a key characteristic of a sine wave.\n- The graph does not have any sharp corners, indicating gradual transitions between values, which is another characteristic of a sine wave.\n- The graph does not exhibit random points or considerable value shifts, which rules out option A) Random noise.\n- Option C) Square wave is ruled out because it is not continuous and has sharp corners, which is not the case with the graph described.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the graph appears to be a sine wave."
