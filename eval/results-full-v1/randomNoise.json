The graph's continuous line exhibits significant and sudden fluctuations in value, which is consistent with random noise waves having considerable value shifts.\n2. The data points are distributed randomly and independently across the graph, showing no discernible structure, which aligns with random noise waves having no discernible structure.\n3.

This aligns with the characteristics of random noise waves.\n- The line shows considerable and sudden variations in its values, but it is not described as having sharp corners (Question 3), which further supports the conclusion that it is a random noise wave.\n\nWhile option B) Sine wave could potentially show some random variations, the information provided emphasizes the line's sudden and considerable variations, which is more characteristic of random noise waves."
