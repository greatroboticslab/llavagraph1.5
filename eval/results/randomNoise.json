    "response": "Based on the given information, I would select option B) Sine wave.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The graph's waveform is described as smooth and periodic, with symmetrical peak excursions, indicating a consistent and repeating pattern, which is characteristic of a sine wave.\n\n2. The graph does not exhibit any random points or sharp corners, suggesting a continuous and predictable flow, which aligns with the nature of a sine wave.\n\n3. The description of the graph's trajectory as smooth and devoid of random jumps further supports the conclusion that it is a sine wave, as sine waves are known for their smooth transitions between values."
