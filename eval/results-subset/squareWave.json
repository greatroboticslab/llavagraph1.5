    "response": "Based on the provided information, the graph is a square wave. \n\nThis conclusion is based on the characteristics mentioned in the questions:\n\n- The line is described as non-random, yet discontinuous, with abrupt transitions to symmetrical peak values (Question 1).\n- The graph's continuous line demonstrates a predetermined, repetitive pattern of level changes (Question 2), which is a hallmark of a square wave.\n- The graph contains sharp corners where it jumps from one value to another (Question 3), further supporting the conclusion that the graph is a square wave.\n\nThe characteristics of a square wave, such as abrupt transitions and sharp corners, match the description provided in the questions. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Square wave."

    "response": "Based on the provided information, I conclude that the graph is a square wave.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows: The graph is described as discontinuous, exhibiting abrupt transitions to equal positive and negative extrema, and displaying sharp angular transitions and sudden drops. This matches the characteristics of a square wave, which is known for having sharp corners where it jumps from one value to another. Although the graph has a discernible structure, it does not have a gradual or continuous pattern like a sine wave, and it does not have random points or value alterations characteristic of random noise."

This indicates that the graph is made up of discrete states rather than a continuous line. Additionally, the graph contains sharp corners, which further supports this conclusion. Square waves are known to be discontinuous, having sharp corners where it jumps from one value to another. The fact that the graph does not have a discernible structure also aligns with the characteristics of a square wave, as they are known to lack a smooth, continuous pattern."
