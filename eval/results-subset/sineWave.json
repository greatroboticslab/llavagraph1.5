    "response": "Based on the information provided, I would select option B) Sine wave. \n\nThe reason for this decision is as follows:\n\n1. The graph's waveform is described as having \"smooth, rhythmic undulations\" with \"equal positive and negative peak heights.\" This suggests a continuous and predictable pattern, which is characteristic of a sine wave.\n\n2. The graph does not have sharp corners or randomly distributed points, which eliminates the possibility of a square wave (option C) and random noise (option A).\n\n3. The graph's continuous line with \"seamless curve\" and \"no sudden drops or corners\" further supports the conclusion that it is a sine wave.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B) Sine wave."

    "response": "Based on the information provided, I would select option B) Sine wave.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The description states that the wave's periodic nature is reflected in its smooth, symmetrical oscillation between maximum and minimum values. This indicates a continuous and smooth transition between values, which is characteristic of a sine wave.\n\n2. The graph does not show any random points, which rules out option A) Random noise. \n\n3. The graph does not contain sharp corners, which rules out option C) Square wave.\n\n4. The description of the graph as having a coherent, uninterrupted, and non-random pattern also aligns with the characteristics of a sine wave.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I conclude that the graph is a sine wave."
