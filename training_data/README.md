## Synthetic Image Generation Description
The generation script is located at: TrainingInputdata_folder.py

To generate synthetic images, run:
```Shell
bash

python TrainingInputdata_folder.py
```

For each original image in your dataset, the script generates three types of waveform variations, each with 5 versions: Random Noise (5 variations), Sine Wave (5 variations), and Square Wave (5 variations), resulting in a total of 15 synthetic images per original image. 
Each generated synthetic image is composed of the following elements: the original instrument panel as the background, a new waveform overlay positioned at coordinates (80, 200), waveform lines in purple (color code #b43ed1), and follows a clear file naming convention: {source}_{original_filename}_{type}{number}.png.
